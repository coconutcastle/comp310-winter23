# ECSE 427 Assignment 1 Code

**Author:** Cecile Dai

**McGill ID:** 260923343

This code uses the starter code from [the project repository](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/balmau/comp310-winter23).

Note that due to using a separate project repository than the one originally submitted and having it be corrected very late, the autograder has never successfully found this repository. Therefore, I cannot say for certain that there will be no compilation errors/warnings or issues that arise remotely not not locally. 

## To Run

### Compilation

Navigate to *src* from the root folder before compiling and running.

```
cd src
make clean
make mysh
```

### Interactive Mode

Run `./mysh` .

### Batch Mode

To run batch mode with one of the test case text files, run `./mysh < ../testcases/assignment1/<filename>.txt` .
